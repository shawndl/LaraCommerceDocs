  Step 1: Point Laravel's Dusk to the Test Database
</h2>
<p>
  In order to point Laravel's Dusk to the testing database simple generate a new <span class="has-text-info">
  .env.example</span> file using the <span class="has-text-info">php artisan publish:env</span> command.
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
  php artisan publish:env
</pre>
<p>
  After the .env.example file has been generated, it must be renamed <span class="has-text-info">.env.dusk.local
  </span>.  The .env.dusk.local file will provide all the settings that will be used for testing
  the browser, including the test database.  Open the .env.dusk.local file and delete everything but the
  following settings.  Make sure that the DB_CONNECTION and DB_DATABASE reflect your testing database.
</p>
<div class="box">
  APP_ENV=local <br />
  APP_KEY= //app key from your original .env file <br />
  APP_DEBUG=true <br />
  APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug <br />
  APP_URL= //host name from homestead <br />
  <br />
  <span class="has-text-success">DB_CONNECTION=sqlite_testing</span> <br />
</div>
<p>
  You are now ready to begin testing the browser.  To run browser tests simply enter <span class="has-text-info">
  php artisan dusk</span> in your terminal.
</p>
<pre class="code-block">
  php artisan dusk
</pre>
